# Welcome to MATLAB_stores!
Here is the repo where I will store my MATLAB scripts. For a start, I will begin uploading my school assignments and some assorted functions which I automated to use frequently for fun and work.

## Requirements
There are no requirements and prerequisites to using MATLAB except for the software. I am using MATLAB version R2021a.

## Repository Contents Explanation
In this repo, you will find two folders, which I explain below:

- **Assorted function files**
Here is the folder where I will store my frequently used functions. The inspiration for this came when I was too tired to double-check my workings for the math-intensive ones (I am not lazy I swear).

**Bisection.m** performs the bisection method, a way to find the roots of a function f by approximating the interval in which the roots lie in.
**cramer.m** covers Cramer's rule for solving linear equations of size Ax=B.
**gausselim.m** covers the Gauss-Jordan elimination method, a row reduction method for solving linear equations of Ax=B. Currently, this only solves for matrix size (3,3).
**numbersieve.m** sieves out negative numbers out of a 1D array of numbers given. Something that I made out of boredom:)

- **Computational Thinking Course (CH2107)**
Here is the folder where I store my assignment from my school courses, questions and results included. Just so you know, questions repeat year after year, so referring to this will not be of much help for your school (sadly).
I mainly use MATLAB scripts for the assignment, however, there are some **'.sfit'** formatted files which I used the Curve Fitting function of MATLAB to obtain.

The Curve Fitting function of MATLAB is similar to the simple regression model as one will obtain using Excel.

## Improvements & Updates
I made this repo for 2 reasons:
1. To showcase my MATLAB journey: what I have done so far and in the future
2. Practice my git skills

I will update whenever I made something new here.

That's all, thank you for reading!
